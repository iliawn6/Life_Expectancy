# Life expectany index prediction ðŸ’¡
In this project, are going to train a polynomial regression model on a dataset which contains some information about countries in each year.
In the other word, the model will predict the life expectancy index of the given country using some features like GDP, BMI or some diseases
criteria.

<h3 align="left">Datasets:</h3>
<p>
  We have two datasets, the first one is the <code>train</code> dataset and the second one is <code>test</code> dataset which has the same dataset with train except it
doesn't have label (life expectancy). Our train dataset contains 18 columns, in which the first 17 columns are the features and the last column
is the label. Furthermore, the features presented in the dataset represent some characterisics about a country in a specific year. For instance, 
the model will use <code>GDP</code> (gross domestic product) or <code>BMI</code> (body mass index) as effective features to predict the life expectancy index.

<h3 align="left">Model and evaluation:</h3>
In this project, we will use <code>polynomial regression</code> model which is provided by <Code>Scikit-Learn</Code> library. In addition, the model will be evaluated
by <code>r2-score</code> criteria which is also exists in <Code>Scikit-Learn</Code>.
